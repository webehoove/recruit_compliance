Good technology, software and production methods are too. Hence, creating an intuitive e-commerce service, a functional digital bank or a decent brand identity isn’t overwhelmingly challenging.

Therefore, what will differentiate one brand, product or service from another and make it more desirable for their target audiences, isn’t just its functionality. It’s also how it’s experienced in terms of visual design, interaction design, motion design, content, messaging and code. However, great experiences are starting to become commoditized too.
